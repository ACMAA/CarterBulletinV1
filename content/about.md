**The *Carter Bulletin* advances the Amon Carter Museum of American Art’s commitment to knowledge creation through scholarly research on topics drawn from the Museum’s collection, archives, and programs.**

The Amon Carter Museum of American Art was established through the generosity of Amon G. Carter Sr. (1879–1955) to house his collection of paintings and sculpture by Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell; to collect, preserve, and exhibit the finest examples of American art; and to serve all communities through exhibitions, publications, and experiences devoted to the celebration of American creativity.

This inaugural volume of the *Carter Bulletin* benefits from the support of the Gentling Study Center.
